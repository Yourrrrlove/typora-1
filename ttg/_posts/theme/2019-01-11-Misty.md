# Misty Theme

Yet another `subtle`,`elegant` & `unobstructive` theme aimed at the philosophy of `simplicity`, `aesthetic` and `readability`, for the awesome [Typora](https://typora.io/) markdown editor and reader.

Tweaked for both English🇺🇸 & 中文🇨🇳. Works on both macOS & Windows.

## Rendering demo

The above screenshot is a demo for all the styles provided in the Misty Theme, meaning that rendering of all other built-in features of Typora (such as lists, math blocks, etc.) is kept untouched and is supposed to work in default behaviors.

One more rendering demo of introduction text:

## Installation

Download [misty-theme.css](https://github.com/etigerstudio/typora-misty-theme/releases/latest) of your platform and copy it into the themes folder of Typora. Select 'Misty Theme' form the theme list to apply it. You may restart Typora once to help it discover and load the theme file, if 'Misty Theme' cannot be found in the theme list.

For detailed reference, please see [Install Theme](https://theme.typora.io/doc/Install-Theme/)

## Compatibility

This theme is both test on `macOS 10.13.6` and `Windows 10 version 1703`. However, it has not been tested on `Linux` thoroughly yet and will be tested in future.
