# Law

This theme was created to help in creation of law school outlines, or other like areas. Specifically, this theme is made to help create readable material that can be printed and shared as PDF or HTML.

> As a note, this theme has only been tested on Windows, but should work fine on OSX and Linux. I also do not use the Unibody approach, so I have done nothing specific for it.
>
> The ideal end format for this theme is in PDF form.
